# frea-redcogs
Frea Red's cogs, mainly from Elixir and maintained further.

## Why?
I currently work for Elixir bot which also relies on Red, and making the functionality in Frea means that inter-operability wise you can do some things Elixir does. Great substitute for downtimes.

## Is everything replicated from Elixir?
No. This will be an updated, improved version of the cog.

## I'm tired.
> Take a rest, then. I'm proud of all your hard work.
